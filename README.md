# voclibxo

This library is a [`libxo`](https://juniper.github.io/libxo/libxo-manual.html) wrapper for [Vishap Oberon Compiler](https://github.com/vishaps/voc).

## Installation

This library has been tested on [FreeBSD](https://FreeBSD.org) running `voc v2.1.2` from Ports/Packages 

### Using git

1. Clone this repository
2. run `make`
3. You should have the symbol file at `build/xo.sym`
4. You may use the source at `src/xo.Mod`
5. You may run `build/libxoTest` to see some tests.

Technically, this library should be used with [`vipack`](https://github.com/vishaps/vipack), but who has the time eh :)
